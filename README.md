# Kiri Bridge

CN105 HomeKit controller for Mitsubishi heat pumps.

Kiri Bridge is an ESP32 firmware and hardware kit for bringing supported
Mitsubishi heat pumps into Apple HomeKit through the indoor unit's CN105 port.
It is local-first, browser-provisioned, and designed to be recoverable without
command line tools.

- Firmware recovery: <https://kiri.dkt.moe/flash.html>
- Source: <https://github.com/DickyT/kiri-homekit>

## What It Does

- Controls supported Mitsubishi heat pumps through the CN105 connector.
- Exposes the heat pump to Apple HomeKit.
- Provides a local WebUI at `http://<device-ip>:8080/`.
- Supports browser-based BLE WiFi provisioning.
- Supports browser-based firmware recovery with `.kiri` packages.
- Runs locally without a required cloud service.

## Hardware Kit

The intended user path assumes a prebuilt Kiri Bridge kit:

- M5Stack ATOM Lite controller
- two CN105 cable options
- pre-flashed Kiri Bridge installer or firmware
- browser-based setup and recovery flow

Order links are not public yet. The website currently shows an order interest
modal with a contact email.

## For Buyers

If you bought a Kiri Bridge, start here:

- [Installation Guide](./INSTALL.md)
- [Firmware Recovery Guide](./FLASHING.md)

Normal setup is:

1. Power on the Kiri Bridge.
2. Wait for the LED to rapidly blink blue.
3. Open <https://kiri.dkt.moe/ble_provisioning.html>.
4. Provision 2.4 GHz WiFi.
5. Open the device portal at `http://<device-ip>:8080/`.
6. Pair with Apple Home.
7. Connect the CN105 cable to the Mitsubishi indoor unit.

If normal setup fails, use the browser flasher at
<https://kiri.dkt.moe/flash.html> with the latest installer package from
GitHub Releases.

## Firmware Releases

Release packages are published as `.kiri` files:

- `kiri_installer_<version>.kiri`: recovery and first-time restore path.
- `kiri_bridge_<version>.kiri`: production firmware.

Users should download release packages from GitHub Releases. Building from
source is for developers and is not required for normal installation.

## Current Status

Kiri Bridge is actively developed. The current ESP-IDF firmware includes:

- real CN105 UART transport enabled by default
- Apple HomeKit bridge
- local WebUI
- BLE WiFi provisioning
- installer/recovery firmware
- browser flasher and provisioning pages
- SPIFFS-backed diagnostics and logs

Final long-run validation across more Mitsubishi indoor unit models is still
ongoing.

## Development Notes

This project targets ESP-IDF and Espressif ESP HomeKit SDK. The production
firmware and installer firmware intentionally have separate WebUIs today:

- production WebUI lives in `components/web/pages`
- installer WebUI is embedded in `debug_apps/cn105_probe/main/app_main.cpp`

When changing settings, OTA, HomeKit pairing, safety copy, or CN105 behavior,
check whether both UIs need the same behavior.
