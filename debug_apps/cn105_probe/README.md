# Installer / Probe App

This is a standalone ESP-IDF installer firmware for first-run setup and CN105
hardware validation.

It replaces the old serial-only CN105 probe. The app now provides:

- BLE Wi-Fi provisioning through Espressif's mobile provisioning app using
  Security 1 and PoP `abcd1234`.
- A no-password installer SoftAP on every boot. The AP SSID matches the BLE
  provisioning name, such as `PROV_KIRI_90`.
- Captive portal DNS for SoftAP users. If the OS does not auto-open the portal,
  browse to `http://192.168.4.1/`.
- An installer WebUI on port `80` over SoftAP and over the provisioned STA
  network.
- CN105 auto-probing from the browser using user-selected RX/TX GPIO pins.
- LED GPIO color test for WS2812-style status LEDs.
- Full-overwrite writes to the formal firmware's `device_cfg` NVS namespace.
- OTA upload of the formal firmware app binary.

The installer uses the same OTA partition layout as the formal firmware:

- `nvs`
- `otadata`
- `phy_init`
- `ota_0`
- `ota_1`
- `spiffs`

## UI Maintenance Note

The installer WebUI is not code-level reused from the production WebUI yet.
Production UI source lives under `components/web/pages`, while this installer
UI is embedded in `main/app_main.cpp`. If you change Device Settings, CN105
settings, OTA upload/apply behavior, or safety warning copy in either place,
check whether the other UI needs the same update.

## Build And Flash

From the repository root:

```bash
./build.py --app installer build
./build.py --app installer flash-auto --monitor
```

Every successful build also exports a packaged firmware set into:

```text
firmware_exports/<version>/
```

The four flash images are renamed as:

```text
<project_name>_<version>_<0xOFFSET>.bin
```

The legacy app alias still works:

```bash
./build.py --app cn105-probe build
```

## First-Run Flow

1. Flash the installer firmware.
2. Connect either through the installer SoftAP or through BLE provisioning.
3. For SoftAP setup, join `PROV_KIRI_XX` with no password and use the
   captive portal or open `http://192.168.4.1/`.
4. For BLE setup, use Espressif's mobile provisioning app with the BLE service
   name printed in serial logs, Security 1, and Proof of Possession `abcd1234`.
5. The WebUI is available at `http://<installer-ip>/`.
6. Run CN105 auto-probe with the physical RX/TX GPIO pins.
7. Test the status LED GPIO if needed.
8. Save step 1 so the installer writes the full `device_cfg` NVS set.
9. Optionally run the step 2 CN105 smoke test.
10. Upload the formal firmware app binary from the exported package:
   `firmware_exports/<version>/kiri_bridge_<version>_0x20000.bin`
11. Click `Reboot and Apply OTA`.

After reboot, the formal firmware reads the NVS values written by the installer
and starts normally with the same partition table.

## CN105 Probe Notes

The auto-probe walks:

- `2400 / 4800 / 9600`
- push-pull
- push-pull + RX pullup
- open-drain + RX pullup
- open-drain + TX/RX pullup
- CONNECT `0x5A` and `0x5B`

Only legal CN105 responses are treated as a positive match:

- `0x7A / 0x7B` connect acknowledgements
- `0x62` info responses
- `0x61` SET acknowledgements

Echoed request packets are counted as RX bytes but are not treated as a legal
CN105 response.
